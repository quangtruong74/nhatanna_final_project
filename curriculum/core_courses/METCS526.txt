Title: Data Structures and Algorithms
Credits: 4
Description: This course covers and relates fundamental components of programs. Students use various data structures to solve computational problems, and implement data structures using a high-level programming language. Algorithms are created, decomposed, and expressed as pseudocode. The running time of various algorithms and their computational complexity are analyzed. 
Prerequisite: MET CS300 and either MET CS520 or MET CS521, or instructor's consent.
